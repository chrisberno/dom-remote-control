Demonstrates Toggle ON/OFF of a DOM modal using socket.io

# [Picture-In-Picture Overlay Apps For Smart TV](https://chrisberno.net/post/socket-modals/)

**üí° EARLY STAGE STUFF HERE**
This code is a work in progress and part of a series I intend to develop around immersive and interactive media. It runs, but the features are very limited in this repo, partially because understanding at this base level will help us build and expand the functionality. 

**‚ñ∂Ô∏è TO RUN**

npm install
node app.js  // 'nodemon start' if you've got nodemon installed
Open and point a browser to http://localhost:8989/
Open and point a second browser to http://localhost:8989/remote.html

**‚òëÔ∏è TO DO**
- Configure the express app for https on port 8989 - The rest of the site @ https://cityscreen.network runs ok on https but the app crashes üßê
